The human ability to think abstractly may be unparalleled in the animal kingdom. Humans are one ofonly six species to pass the mirror test — which tests whether an animal recognizes itsreflection as an image of itself — along with chimpanzees, orangutans, dolphins, and possiblypigeons. In October 2006, three elephants at the Bronx Zoo also passed this test.[42] Humans underthe age of 2 typically fail this test.[43] However, this may be a matter of degree rather than asharp divide. Monkeys have been trained to apply abstract rules in tasks.[44]
